the yellow wallpaper

by charlotte perkins gilman


it is very seldom that mere ordinary people like john and myself secure
ancestral halls for the summer

a colonial mansion a hereditary estate i would say a haunted house
and reach the height of romantic felicitybut that would be asking too
much of fate

still i will proudly declare that there is something queer about it

else why should it be let so cheaply and why have stood so long
untenanted

john laughs at me of course but one expects that in marriage

john is practical in the extreme he has no patience with faith an
intense horror of superstition and he scoffs openly at any talk of
things not to be felt and seen and put down in figures

john is a physician and perhapsi would not say it to a living soul
of course but this is dead paper and a great relief to my
mindperhaps that is one reason i do not get well faster

you see he does not believe i am sick

and what can one do

if a physician of high standing and ones own husband assures friends
and relatives that there is really nothing the matter with one but
temporary nervous depressiona slight hysterical tendencywhat is one
to do

my brother is also a physician and also of high standing and he says
the same thing

so i take phosphates or phosphiteswhichever it is and tonics and
journeys and air and exercise and am absolutely forbidden to work
until i am well again

personally i disagree with their ideas

personally i believe that congenial work with excitement and change
would do me good

but what is one to do

i did write for a while in spite of them but it does exhaust me a good
dealhaving to be so sly about it or else meet with heavy opposition

i sometimes fancy that in my condition if i had less opposition and
more society and stimulusbut john says the very worst thing i can do
is to think about my condition and i confess it always makes me feel
bad

so i will let it alone and talk about the house

the most beautiful place it is quite alone standing well back from
the road quite three miles from the village it makes me think of
english places that you read about for there are hedges and walls and
gates that lock and lots of separate little houses for the gardeners
and people

there is a delicious garden i never saw such a gardenlarge and shady
full of boxbordered paths and lined with long grapecovered arbors
with seats under them

there were greenhouses too but they are all broken now

there was some legal trouble i believe something about the heirs and
coheirs anyhow the place has been empty for years

that spoils my ghostliness i am afraid but i dont carethere is
something strange about the housei can feel it

i even said so to john one moonlight evening but he said what i felt
was a draught and shut the window

i get unreasonably angry with john sometimes im sure i never used to
be so sensitive i think it is due to this nervous condition

but john says if i feel so i shall neglect proper selfcontrol so i
take pains to control myselfbefore him at leastand that makes me
very tired

i dont like our room a bit i wanted one downstairs that opened on the
piazza and had roses all over the window and such pretty oldfashioned
chintz hangings but john would not hear of it

he said there was only one window and not room for two beds and no
near room for him if he took another

he is very careful and loving and hardly lets me stir without special
direction

i have a schedule prescription for each hour in the day he takes all
care from me and so i feel basely ungrateful not to value it more

he said we came here solely on my account that i was to have perfect
rest and all the air i could get your exercise depends on your
strength my dear said he and your food somewhat on your appetite
but air you can absorb all the time so we took the nursery at the
top of the house

it is a big airy room the whole floor nearly with windows that look
all ways and air and sunshine galore it was nursery first and then
playground and gymnasium i should judge for the windows are barred
for little children and there are rings and things in the walls

the paint and paper look as if a boys school had used it it is
stripped offthe paperin great patches all around the head of my bed
about as far as i can reach and in a great place on the other side of
the room low down i never saw a worse paper in my life

one of those sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic
sin

it is dull enough to confuse the eye in following pronounced enough to
constantly irritate and provoke study and when you follow the lame
uncertain curves for a little distance they suddenly commit
suicideplunge off at outrageous angles destroy themselves in
unheardof contradictions

the color is repellant almost revolting a smouldering unclean
yellow strangely faded by the slowturning sunlight

it is a dull yet lurid orange in some places a sickly sulphur tint in
others

no wonder the children hated it i should hate it myself if i had to
live in this room long

there comes john and i must put this awayhe hates to have me write a
word

we have been here two weeks and i havent felt like writing before
since that first day

i am sitting by the window now up in this atrocious nursery and there
is nothing to hinder my writing as much as i please save lack of
strength

john is away all day and even some nights when his cases are serious

i am glad my case is not serious

but these nervous troubles are dreadfully depressing

john does not know how much i really suffer he knows there is no
reason to suffer and that satisfies him

of course it is only nervousness it does weigh on me so not to do my
duty in any way

i meant to be such a help to john such a real rest and comfort and
here i am a comparative burden already

nobody would believe what an effort it is to do what little i am
ableto dress and entertain and order things

it is fortunate mary is so good with the baby such a dear baby

and yet i cannot be with him it makes me so nervous

i suppose john never was nervous in his life he laughs at me so about
this wallpaper

at first he meant to repaper the room but afterwards he said that i
was letting it get the better of me and that nothing was worse for a
nervous patient than to give way to such fancies

he said that after the wallpaper was changed it would be the heavy
bedstead and then the barred windows and then that gate at the head
of the stairs and so on

you know the place is doing you good he said and really dear i
dont care to renovate the house just for a three months rental

then do let us go downstairs i said there are such pretty rooms
there

then he took me in his arms and called me a blessed little goose and
said he would go down cellar if i wished and have it whitewashed into
the bargain

but he is right enough about the beds and windows and things

it is as airy and comfortable a room as any one need wish and of
course i would not be so silly as to make him uncomfortable just for a
whim

im really getting quite fond of the big room all but that horrid
paper

out of one window i can see the garden those mysterious deepshaded
arbors the riotous oldfashioned flowers and bushes and gnarly trees

out of another i get a lovely view of the bay and a little private
wharf belonging to the estate there is a beautiful shaded lane that
runs down there from the house i always fancy i see people walking in
these numerous paths and arbors but john has cautioned me not to give
way to fancy in the least he says that with my imaginative power and
habit of storymaking a nervous weakness like mine is sure to lead to
all manner of excited fancies and that i ought to use my will and good
sense to check the tendency so i try

i think sometimes that if i were only well enough to write a little it
would relieve the press of ideas and rest me

but i find i get pretty tired when i try

it is so discouraging not to have any advice and companionship about my
work when i get really well john says we will ask cousin henry and
julia down for a long visit but he says he would as soon put
fireworks in my pillowcase as to let me have those stimulating people
about now

i wish i could get well faster

but i must not think about that this paper looks to me as if it knew
what a vicious influence it had

there is a recurrent spot where the pattern lolls like a broken neck
and two bulbous eyes stare at you upsidedown

i get positively angry with the impertinence of it and the
everlastingness up and down and sideways they crawl and those absurd
unblinking eyes are everywhere there is one place where two breadths
didnt match and the eyes go all up and down the line one a little
higher than the other

i never saw so much expression in an inanimate thing before and we all
know how much expression they have i used to lie awake as a child and
get more entertainment and terror out of blank walls and plain
furniture than most children could find in a toystore

i remember what a kindly wink the knobs of our big old bureau used to
have and there was one chair that always seemed like a strong friend

i used to feel that if any of the other things looked too fierce i
could always hop into that chair and be safe

the furniture in this room is no worse than inharmonious however for
we had to bring it all from downstairs i suppose when this was used as
a playroom they had to take the nursery things out and no wonder i
never saw such ravages as the children have made here

the wallpaper as i said before is torn off in spots and it sticketh
closer than a brotherthey must have had perseverance as well as
hatred

then the floor is scratched and gouged and splintered the plaster
itself is dug out here and there and this great heavy bed which is
all we found in the room looks as if it had been through the wars

but i dont mind it a bitonly the paper

there comes johns sister such a dear girl as she is and so careful
of me i must not let her find me writing

she is a perfect and enthusiastic housekeeper and hopes for no better
profession i verily believe she thinks it is the writing which made me
sick

but i can write when she is out and see her a long way off from these
windows

there is one that commands the road a lovely shaded winding road
and one that just looks off over the country a lovely country too
full of great elms and velvet meadows

this wallpaper has a kind of subpattern in a different shade a
particularly irritating one for you can only see it in certain lights
and not clearly then

but in the places where it isnt faded and where the sun is just so i
can see a strange provoking formless sort of figure that seems to
sulk about behind that silly and conspicuous front design

theres sister on the stairs

well the fourth of july is over the people are gone and i am tired
out john thought it might do me good to see a little company so we
just had mother and nellie and the children down for a week

of course i didnt do a thing jennie sees to everything now

but it tired me all the same

john says if i dont pick up faster he shall send me to weir mitchell
in the fall

but i dont want to go there at all i had a friend who was in his
hands once and she says he is just like john and my brother only more
so

besides it is such an undertaking to go so far

i dont feel as if it was worth while to turn my hand over for
anything and im getting dreadfully fretful and querulous

i cry at nothing and cry most of the time

of course i dont when john is here or anybody else but when i am
alone

and i am alone a good deal just now john is kept in town very often by
serious cases and jennie is good and lets me alone when i want her to

so i walk a little in the garden or down that lovely lane sit on the
porch under the roses and lie down up here a good deal

im getting really fond of the room in spite of the wallpaper perhaps
because of the wallpaper

it dwells in my mind so

i lie here on this great immovable bedit is nailed down i believeand
follow that pattern about by the hour it is as good as gymnastics i
assure you i start well say at the bottom down in the corner over
there where it has not been touched and i determine for the thousandth
time that i will follow that pointless pattern to some sort of a
conclusion

i know a little of the principle of design and i know this thing was
not arranged on any laws of radiation or alternation or repetition
or symmetry or anything else that i ever heard of

it is repeated of course by the breadths but not otherwise

looked at in one way each breadth stands alone the bloated curves and
flourishesa kind of debased romanesque with delirium tremensgo
waddling up and down in isolated columns of fatuity

but on the other hand they connect diagonally and the sprawling
outlines run off in great slanting waves of optic horror like a lot of
wallowing seaweeds in full chase

the whole thing goes horizontally too at least it seems so and i
exhaust myself in trying to distinguish the order of its going in that
direction

they have used a horizontal breadth for a frieze and that adds
wonderfully to the confusion

there is one end of the room where it is almost intact and there when
the crosslights fade and the low sun shines directly upon it i can
almost fancy radiation after allthe interminable grotesques seem to
form around a common centre and rush off in headlong plunges of equal
distraction

it makes me tired to follow it i will take a nap i guess

i dont know why i should write this

i dont want to

i dont feel able

and i know john would think it absurd but i must say what i feel and
think in some wayit is such a relief

but the effort is getting to be greater than the relief

half the time now i am awfully lazy and lie down ever so much

john says i musnt lose my strength and has me take codliver oil and
lots of tonics and things to say nothing of ale and wine and rare
meat

dear john he loves me very dearly and hates to have me sick i tried
to have a real earnest reasonable talk with him the other day and tell
him how i wish he would let me go and make a visit to cousin henry and
julia

but he said i wasnt able to go nor able to stand it after i got
there and i did not make out a very good case for myself for i was
crying before i had finished

it is getting to be a great effort for me to think straight just this
nervous weakness i suppose

and dear john gathered me up in his arms and just carried me upstairs
and laid me on the bed and sat by me and read to me till it tired my
head

he said i was his darling and his comfort and all he had and that i
must take care of myself for his sake and keep well

he says no one but myself can help me out of it that i must use my
will and selfcontrol and not let any silly fancies run away with me

theres one comfort the baby is well and happy and does not have to
occupy this nursery with the horrid wallpaper

if we had not used it that blessed child would have what a fortunate
escape why i wouldnt have a child of mine an impressionable little
thing live in such a room for worlds

i never thought of it before but it is lucky that john kept me here
after all i can stand it so much easier than a baby you see

of course i never mention it to them any morei am too wisebut i
keep watch of it all the same

there are things in that paper that nobody knows but me or ever will

behind that outside pattern the dim shapes get clearer every day

it is always the same shape only very numerous

and it is like a woman stooping down and creeping about behind that
pattern i dont like it a bit i wonderi begin to thinki wish john
would take me away from here

it is so hard to talk with john about my case because he is so wise
and because he loves me so

but i tried it last night

it was moonlight the moon shines in all around just as the sun does

i hate to see it sometimes it creeps so slowly and always comes in by
one window or another

john was asleep and i hated to waken him so i kept still and watched
the moonlight on that undulating wallpaper till i felt creepy

the faint figure behind seemed to shake the pattern just as if she
wanted to get out

i got up softly and went to feel and see if the paper did move and
when i came back john was awake

what is it little girl he said dont go walking about like
thatyoull get cold

i thought it was a good time to talk so i told him that i really was
not gaining here and that i wished he would take me away

why darling said he our lease will be up in three weeks and i
cant see how to leave before

the repairs are not done at home and i cannot possibly leave town
just now of course if you were in any danger i could and would but
you really are better dear whether you can see it or not i am a
doctor dear and i know you are gaining flesh and color your
appetite is better i feel really much easier about you

i dont weigh a bit more said i nor as much and my appetite may
be better in the evening when you are here but it is worse in the
morning when you are away

bless her little heart said he with a big hug she shall be as sick
as she pleases but now lets improve the shining hours by going to
sleep and talk about it in the morning

and you wont go away i asked gloomily

why how can i dear it is only three weeks more and then we will
take a nice little trip of a few days while jennie is getting the house
ready really dear you are better

better in body perhapsi began and stopped short for he sat up
straight and looked at me with such a stern reproachful look that i
could not say another word

my darling said he i beg of you for my sake and for our childs
sake as well as for your own that you will never for one instant let
that idea enter your mind there is nothing so dangerous so
fascinating to a temperament like yours it is a false and foolish
fancy can you not trust me as a physician when i tell you so

so of course i said no more on that score and we went to sleep before
long he thought i was asleep first but i wasnti lay there for
hours trying to decide whether that front pattern and the back pattern
really did move together or separately

on a pattern like this by daylight there is a lack of sequence a
defiance of law that is a constant irritant to a normal mind

the color is hideous enough and unreliable enough and infuriating
enough but the pattern is torturing

you think you have mastered it but just as you get well under way in
following it turns a back somersault and there you are it slaps you
in the face knocks you down and tramples upon you it is like a bad
dream

the outside pattern is a florid arabesque reminding one of a fungus
if you can imagine a toadstool in joints an interminable string of
toadstools budding and sprouting in endless convolutionswhy that is
something like it

that is sometimes

there is one marked peculiarity about this paper a thing nobody seems
to notice but myself and that is that it changes as the light changes

when the sun shoots in through the east windowi always watch for that
first long straight rayit changes so quickly that i never can quite
believe it

that is why i watch it always

by moonlightthe moon shines in all night when there is a mooni
wouldnt know it was the same paper

at night in any kind of light in twilight candlelight lamplight and
worst of all by moonlight it becomes bars the outside pattern i mean
and the woman behind it is as plain as can be

i didnt realize for a long time what the thing was that showed
behindthat dim subpatternbut now i am quite sure it is a woman

by daylight she is subdued quiet i fancy it is the pattern that keeps
her so still it is so puzzling it keeps me quiet by the hour

i lie down ever so much now john says it is good for me and to sleep
all i can

indeed he started the habit by making me lie down for an hour after
each meal

it is a very bad habit i am convinced for you see i dont sleep

and that cultivates deceit for i dont tell them im awakeoh no

the fact is i am getting a little afraid of john

he seems very queer sometimes and even jennie has an inexplicable
look

it strikes me occasionally just as a scientific hypothesis that
perhaps it is the paper

i have watched john when he did not know i was looking and come into
the room suddenly on the most innocent excuses and ive caught him
several times looking at the paper and jennie too i caught jennie
with her hand on it once

she didnt know i was in the room and when i asked her in a quiet a
very quiet voice with the most restrained manner possible what she
was doing with the paper she turned around as if she had been caught
stealing and looked quite angryasked me why i should frighten her so

then she said that the paper stained everything it touched that she
had found yellow smooches on all my clothes and johns and she wished
we would be more careful

did not that sound innocent but i know she was studying that pattern
and i am determined that nobody shall find it out but myself

life is very much more exciting now than it used to be you see i have
something more to expect to look forward to to watch i really do eat
better and am more quiet than i was

john is so pleased to see me improve he laughed a little the other
day and said i seemed to be flourishing in spite of my wallpaper

i turned it off with a laugh i had no intention of telling him it was
because of the wallpaperhe would make fun of me he might even want to
take me away

i dont want to leave now until i have found it out there is a week
more and i think that will be enough

im feeling ever so much better i dont sleep much at night for it is
so interesting to watch developments but i sleep a good deal in the
daytime

in the daytime it is tiresome and perplexing

there are always new shoots on the fungus and new shades of yellow all
over it i cannot keep count of them though i have tried
conscientiously

it is the strangest yellow that wallpaper it makes me think of all
the yellow things i ever sawnot beautiful ones like buttercups but
old foul bad yellow things

but there is something else about that paperthe smell i noticed it
the moment we came into the room but with so much air and sun it was
not bad now we have had a week of fog and rain and whether the
windows are open or not the smell is here

it creeps all over the house

i find it hovering in the diningroom skulking in the parlor hiding
in the hall lying in wait for me on the stairs

it gets into my hair

even when i go to ride if i turn my head suddenly and surprise
itthere is that smell

such a peculiar odor too i have spent hours in trying to analyze it
to find what it smelled like

it is not badat first and very gentle but quite the subtlest most
enduring odor i ever met

in this damp weather it is awful i wake up in the night and find it
hanging over me

it used to disturb me at first i thought seriously of burning the
houseto reach the smell

but now i am used to it the only thing i can think of that it is like
is the color of the paper a yellow smell

there is a very funny mark on this wall low down near the mopboard a
streak that runs round the room it goes behind every piece of
furniture except the bed a long straight even smooch as if it had
been rubbed over and over

i wonder how it was done and who did it and what they did it for
round and round and roundround and round and roundit makes me dizzy

i really have discovered something at last

through watching so much at night when it changes so i have finally
found out

the front pattern does moveand no wonder the woman behind shakes it

sometimes i think there are a great many women behind and sometimes
only one and she crawls around fast and her crawling shakes it all
over

then in the very bright spots she keeps still and in the very shady
spots she just takes hold of the bars and shakes them hard

and she is all the time trying to climb through but nobody could climb
through that patternit strangles so i think that is why it has so
many heads

they get through and then the pattern strangles them off and turns
them upsidedown and makes their eyes white

if those heads were covered or taken off it would not be half so bad

i think that woman gets out in the daytime

and ill tell you whyprivatelyive seen her

i can see her out of every one of my windows

it is the same woman i know for she is always creeping and most
women do not creep by daylight

i see her on that long shaded lane creeping up and down i see her in
those dark grape arbors creeping all around the garden

i see her on that long road under the trees creeping along and when a
carriage comes she hides under the blackberry vines

i dont blame her a bit it must be very humiliating to be caught
creeping by daylight

i always lock the door when i creep by daylight i cant do it at
night for i know john would suspect something at once

and john is so queer now that i dont want to irritate him i wish he
would take another room besides i dont want anybody to get that
woman out at night but myself

i often wonder if i could see her out of all the windows at once

but turn as fast as i can i can only see out of one at one time

and though i always see her she may be able to creep faster than i can
turn

i have watched her sometimes away off in the open country creeping as
fast as a cloud shadow in a high wind

if only that top pattern could be gotten off from the under one i mean
to try it little by little

i have found out another funny thing but i shant tell it this time
it does not do to trust people too much

there are only two more days to get this paper off and i believe john
is beginning to notice i dont like the look in his eyes

and i heard him ask jennie a lot of professional questions about me
she had a very good report to give

she said i slept a good deal in the daytime

john knows i dont sleep very well at night for all im so quiet

he asked me all sorts of questions too and pretended to be very
loving and kind

as if i couldnt see through him

still i dont wonder he acts so sleeping under this paper for three
months

it only interests me but i feel sure john and jennie are secretly
affected by it

hurrah this is the last day but it is enough john is to stay in town
over night and wont be out until this evening

jennie wanted to sleep with methe sly thing but i told her i should
undoubtedly rest better for a night all alone

that was clever for really i wasnt alone a bit as soon as it was
moonlight and that poor thing began to crawl and shake the pattern i
got up and ran to help her

i pulled and she shook i shook and she pulled and before morning we
had peeled off yards of that paper

a strip about as high as my head and half around the room

and then when the sun came and that awful pattern began to laugh at me
i declared i would finish it today

we go away tomorrow and they are moving all my furniture down again
to leave things as they were before

jennie looked at the wall in amazement but i told her merrily that i
did it out of pure spite at the vicious thing

she laughed and said she wouldnt mind doing it herself but i must not
get tired

how she betrayed herself that time

but i am here and no person touches this paper but menot alive

she tried to get me out of the roomit was too patent but i said it
was so quiet and empty and clean now that i believed i would lie down
again and sleep all i could and not to wake me even for dinneri would
call when i woke

so now she is gone and the servants are gone and the things are gone
and there is nothing left but that great bedstead nailed down with the
canvas mattress we found on it

we shall sleep downstairs tonight and take the boat home tomorrow

i quite enjoy the room now it is bare again

how those children did tear about here

this bedstead is fairly gnawed

but i must get to work

i have locked the door and thrown the key down into the front path

i dont want to go out and i dont want to have anybody come in till
john comes

i want to astonish him

ive got a rope up here that even jennie did not find if that woman
does get out and tries to get away i can tie her

but i forgot i could not reach far without anything to stand on

this bed will not move

i tried to lift and push it until i was lame and then i got so angry i
bit off a little piece at one cornerbut it hurt my teeth

then i peeled off all the paper i could reach standing on the floor it
sticks horribly and the pattern just enjoys it all those strangled
heads and bulbous eyes and waddling fungus growths just shriek with
derision

i am getting angry enough to do something desperate to jump out of the
window would be admirable exercise but the bars are too strong even to
try

besides i wouldnt do it of course not i know well enough that a step
like that is improper and might be misconstrued

i dont like to look out of the windows eventhere are so many of those
creeping women and they creep so fast

i wonder if they all come out of that wallpaper as i did

but i am securely fastened now by my wellhidden ropeyou dont get me
out in the road there

i suppose i shall have to get back behind the pattern when it comes
night and that is hard

it is so pleasant to be out in this great room and creep around as i
please

i dont want to go outside i wont even if jennie asks me to

for outside you have to creep on the ground and everything is green
instead of yellow

but here i can creep smoothly on the floor and my shoulder just fits
in that long smooch around the wall so i cannot lose my way

why theres john at the door

it is no use young man you cant open it

how he does call and pound

now hes crying for an axe

it would be a shame to break down that beautiful door

john dear said i in the gentlest voice the key is down by the
front steps under a plantain leaf

that silenced him for a few moments

then he saidvery quietly indeed open the door my darling

i cant said i the key is down by the front door under a plantain
leaf

and then i said it again several times very gently and slowly and
said it so often that he had to go and see and he got it of course
and came in he stopped short by the door

what is the matter he cried for gods sake what are you doing

i kept on creeping just the same but i looked at him over my shoulder

ive got out at last said i in spite of you and jane and ive
pulled off most of the paper so you cant put me back

now why should that man have fainted but he did and right across my
path by the wall so that i had to creep over him every time
