Hello happy potatoes!

The basic functionality of the a3_wordfrequency.pde file was created by Landry. This program
utilizes a file titled "wordfrequency.txt" to graph the number of words that appear at any given
frequency, with the y axis of the graph representing frequency and the x axis representing
the number of words that appear at that frequency. For example, if there are 375 words that appear
twice within the text and 500 words that appear only once, then the bottommost square on the
graph will represent words that appear only once, and the horizontal length of the box will
represent the fact that 500 words appear at this frequency. Then, directly above this will be
another box representing the 375 words that appear twice. To help meet the extra credit requirements
for this project, the size of the boxes have been automatically scaled to ensure that the graph 
always fills as much of the canvas as possible (minus padding around the borders of the canvas for 
aesthetics) without data going off the screen. Additionally, coloring to the boxes was added to
improve the appearance of the graph. After these functionalities were added, Mehmet refactored the
code for readibility, added flexibility to the code, and dramatically improved the appearance of the
graph by utilizing a more complex coloring scheme for the boxes.
